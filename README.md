## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

 - Learned how to use props.children
 - Creating overlays
 - Working with overflow and scroll
 - Modularized CSS
 - And many React concepts...

### Continued development

I adapted various ways to create this app. In some of the components, I used modularized CSS, in some not.
I think I would like to focus more on modularized CSS. 

There was a lot of deep prop drilling involved here, so I believe it is better if I used context or a state management here. Will use these for my next projects.
